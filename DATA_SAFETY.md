# Data Safety Guidelines

This document provides instructions on how to maintain data safety and prevent system failures in your CRM application.

## Automated Backups

The CRM has an automated backup system that creates database backups every 24 hours. These backups are stored in the `/backups` directory.

### Manual Backups

You can also trigger manual backups anytime by running:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/backup.ts
```

This is recommended before:
- Making significant data changes
- Updating the application
- Any planned maintenance

## Restoring from Backup

If you need to restore data from a backup:

1. Find the backup file in the `/backups` directory (they are timestamped)
2. Run the restore command:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/restore.ts /path/to/backup/file.sql
```

## Best Practices to Prevent Data Loss

1. **Regular Testing**: Periodically test the backup and restore functionality to ensure it works correctly.

2. **Verify Data Migrations**: When updating the database schema, verify that all data has been properly migrated.

3. **Export Important Data**: Periodically export critical data (customers, sales, leads) to CSV files as an additional safeguard.

4. **Check Logs**: Monitor application logs regularly for any unusual errors or warnings.

5. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to their latest stable versions.

6. **Test New Features**: Always test new features in a development environment before deploying to production.

7. **Data Validation**: The system has built-in data validation. Never bypass or disable these validation rules.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the application:

1. Check the server logs for error messages
2. Look for a unique error ID (e.g., "ERROR-1a2b3c") in the logs
3. Verify that the database connection is working
4. Check that all API endpoints are responding correctly

## Emergency Recovery

If the application experiences a critical failure:

1. Stop the server
2. Create a backup of the current database state (even if corrupted)
3. Restore from the most recent backup
4. Restart the server
5. If issues persist, contact support with your error logs

Remember, prevention is better than recovery. Regular backups and careful testing are your best protection against data loss.
