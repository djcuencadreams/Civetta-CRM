# Error Handling System Documentation

This document explains the comprehensive error handling system implemented in our CRM application.

## Overview

Our error handling system is a multi-layered defense mechanism designed to:
1. Prevent unhandled promise rejections from breaking the application
2. Suppress unnecessary error messages from aborted requests
3. Prevent Vite error overlays from appearing during development
4. Provide a consistent approach to error logging and reporting
5. Provide debug information for actual errors that need attention

## Architecture

The error handling system consists of several layers:

### 1. Unified Entry Point
The `client/src/lib/error-handling-index.ts` file provides a single entry point for initializing all error handling mechanisms. This is imported and called from App.tsx.

### 2. Global Error Handlers
Global error handlers intercept unhandled errors and unhandled promise rejections, filtering out known benign errors like AbortErrors.

### 3. AbortController Patches
Custom patches for the AbortController and fetch API to properly handle aborted requests without triggering error messages or overlays.

### 4. Vite Runtime Error Plugin Fixes
Specific fixes for Vite's runtime error overlay to prevent it from showing for aborted requests.

### 5. CSS-based Error Suppression
CSS rules to hide error overlays that might still appear despite other measures.

### 6. MutationObserver-based DOM Cleanup
Monitors the DOM for error overlays and removes them if they appear.

## Usage

The error handling system is automatically initialized when the app starts via `initializeErrorHandling()` in App.tsx.

### How to handle errors in your code

1. **For fetch requests or any async operations that might be canceled:**
   ```typescript
   try {
     const response = await fetch('/api/data');
     const data = await response.json();
     return data;
   } catch (error) {
     if (isAbortError(error)) {
       // Just log at debug level and return or rethrow as needed
       console.debug('Request was aborted, this is expected');
       return null; // or rethrow if needed
     }
     
     // Handle other errors
     logError(error, { source: 'fetchData' });
     throw error; // Or handle appropriately
   }
   ```

2. **For general error logging:**
   ```typescript
   import { logError } from '@/lib/error-handling-index';
   
   try {
     // Some operation that might fail
   } catch (error) {
     logError(error, { source: 'componentName', context: { additionalInfo: 'value' } });
     // Handle the error appropriately
   }
   ```

## Testing the Error Handling System

1. Run the abort test to verify that AbortController errors are properly handled:
   ```
   node test-abort.js
   ```

2. Test in the application by navigating to the `/error-test` route which contains components that trigger various error scenarios.

3. Test by quickly navigating between pages while data is loading to trigger AbortController errors.

## Error Handling Best Practices

1. Always check for AbortError in catch blocks for async operations.
2. Use AbortController and AbortSignal for all fetch requests.
3. Use the logError function for consistent error logging.
4. Wrap components with ErrorBoundary where appropriate.
5. Cancel in-flight requests when components unmount.

## Implementation Details

### AbortController Patches

We patch the native AbortController to make it more resilient:
- Track all active controllers in a global registry
- Enhance the abort() method to accept a reason
- Add custom error detection to prevent unnecessary error messages

### Vite Error Plugin Fix

We patch Vite's runtime error plugin to specifically ignore AbortController errors:
- Monitor and intercept error overlay creation
- Check error messages for common abort patterns
- Prevent overlays for known benign errors

### CSS-based Error Suppression

We add CSS rules to hide error overlays that might still appear:
```css
div[data-vite-error-overlay],
div[style*="z-index: 99999"] {
  display: none !important;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing error overlays or unhandled promise rejections:

1. Check if the error is coming from a third-party library. We might need to add specific handling for it.
2. Ensure you're using `isAbortError()` to check for abort errors in your catch blocks.
3. Make sure you're properly cleaning up async operations when components unmount.
4. Check if the error is actually a legitimate error that needs to be fixed.
